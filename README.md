This screenshot is from Docker Desktop, showing the details of your currently running container. You have one running container with the auto‑generated name youthful_davinc, created from the image named food. Its unique container ID is 8902613db79b. The container’s internal port 80 is mapped to your host machine’s port 8080, which means you can access the application running inside the container by opening http://localhost:8080 in your browser. The container is currently using 0% CPU and around 12.55 MB of memory, and it was started about two minutes ago. On the right‑hand side, you have action options such as viewing logs, restarting, or removing the container. At the top of the screen, Docker Desktop shows overall resource usage, like total CPU and memory consumption.
